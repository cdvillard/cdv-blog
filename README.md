# Charles Villard's personal blog

This is my personal blog, cribbed from [Astro's blog template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog). I've done what I can to make it uniquely mine. Hope you enjoy it.

Features:

- âœ… SEO-friendly setup with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- âœ… Full Markdown support
- âœ… RSS 2.0 generation
- âœ… Sitemap.xml generation

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
|:----------------  |:-------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn`            | Installs dependencies                        |
| `yarn dev`        | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `yarn build`      | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `yarn preview`    | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## TODOs

- [ ] Figure out how to leverage Astro's functionality in JavaScript utility functions like in [utils/getPosts.js](./src/utils/getPosts.js).
- [ ] Write more content!
