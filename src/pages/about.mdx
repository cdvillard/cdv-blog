<h1 class="display">About</h1>

I'm a front-end web developer and software engineer with a penchant for design systems, the JAMStack, and building tools that help people build things.

I started my career teaching myself front-end web development, and have since worked on projects focused on brand management, newsletter publication, eCommerce and retail, and more.

In my downtime, I help raise two beautiful daughters with my partner and five cats in Riverview, Florida (yes, the cats help too.) I also enjoy video games, table-top roleplaying games, drawing, movies and cooking, and moonlight as a voice-actor of many characters in productions of "The Friar," a mini-episode drama series.

## Community

Originally hailing from Miami, Florida, I was a volunteer organizer for [Front-End Miami](https://frontend.miami/), formerly Front-End Developers of Miami. It's a casual software engineering MeetUp group with a focus on front-end engineering and web development. Since moving to Florida's western coast, I still help moderate [its Slack channel](https://fedm.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzgyMTMzNTI5NDQ3LWUzNTc2MmJjYzE0NTg1YjI0YmFmNjE3MGY4MzAxYmZlNjlkMTViNDEyODdkYTJhMzAwNjBjMzYxNzRiMzNkMzY#/shared-invite/email).
