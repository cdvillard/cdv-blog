  Web developers subscribe to at least one of a few tropes. These include but are not limited to: strong opinions about tabs vs spaces, figuring out how to exit vim, and hitting walls trying to build a personal website. I recently existed as that last trope for weeks when starting to revamp my personal website after a few years of what was basically an "under construction" site. After coming to the conclusion of just starting with what I have, here are some takeaways I think might benefit others, especially those starting from scratch.

  ## Dare we ask why?

  The easiest way to safeguard your time and energy is to ask yourself, "Why even, though?" If the only answer you can give is that you don't need one, congratulations. You win the Professional Web Development Game! You're all set and are likely a being of elevated development/engineeering prowess.

  All joking aside, not everyone <em>needs</em> a website. Plenty of developers, engineers, and tech workers have great careers without one, but it doesn't hurt to have some kind of personal branding. What's more, building your own website grants you significant of control over how you're represented online.

  As for my own reasons, I'd like to create a platform to grow on and share my growth on. Rehashing the last few years would be repetitive but suffice to say that, like many others, it took a toll on me too. Over the course of the pandemic, I've felt like my career's stagnated, so much so that I gave up on trying to create or learn too much of anything, despite some middling efforts. My hope was I could try again when things leveled out into a "new normal," but they still haven't and I'm tired of waiting, so here we are.

  ## Plan your content

  Brendan Lee Mulligan once borrowed a phrase from supposedly Voltaire: "I didn't have the time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a longer one instead." Saying a lot with a little is indicative of well-crafted writing. Words are the primary building block of a website, so it's important to make them concise, descriptive and expressive. Take the time to plan out what your initial pages are going to say. Figure out what you want your website to say and plan for that. You'll save yourself a lot of time and headache instead of hemming and hawing between building an "About" page or a "Work" page.
