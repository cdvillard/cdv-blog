# AI Usage

All content published on this website has been thought of, scrutinized, overly considered, scrapped, rehashed, and written by me, usually after hemming and hawing on the subject for hours. While I will at times reach for AI to clarify something from my research or handle minor tasks, everything I publish here represents my own genuine thoughts, views, insights, and quips, for better or worse.

I do occassionaly reach for an AI tool in my coding, but typically to understand why I'm getting an infuriating error for the fifth time. I will not use it to generate or suggest code. My code, like this website, is my own. I'd like to think I'm above hallucinations.

## AI Permissions

While we're on the subject, I'd also like to explicitly disallow my content's use as training data for any AI project without my explicit consent. While I can't stop you with just a pithy statement, you're more than welcome to reach and ask me for permission. We can discuss your need and potential payment then.

## Why this page?

This page is my take on the [AI manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto) by Damola Morenikeji. I'd like those who visit my website to know that I am not a robot.
