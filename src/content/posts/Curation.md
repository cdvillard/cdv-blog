Some of my favorite Internet finds are websites dedicated to telling their readers about a single subject. Curated and maintained by a single person or a community of folks in their spare time, they are rarely terribly fancy. There aren't any complicated algorithmic suggestions, and no pressure to pay with your money or data. They might have a blog, update feed, or tools of some kind, but these websites are intentionally designed to stand as independent, growing, evergreen repositories of information about a single subject.

I loved websites like these when I was learning how to code like Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/), and Jon Chan's [Bento](https://bento.io). Industry-specific websites that I've kept coming across over the years include Dee Bradley Baker's ["I Want To Be A Voice Actor!"](https://iwanttobeavoiceactor.com/) and Jason Thor Hall's [develop.games](https://www.develop.games/). I even tried to develop one called Miami Data back when I was trying to learn about civic tech.\

There are of course more websites out there on all kinds of subjects. These were just the first I thought of when I saw Chad Stewart's recently launched [Job Search Resources](https://job-search-resources.techishiring.com/) site on TechIsHiring. Visitors to the site can check out resources across a few categories and submit their own. Chad's goal is to grow it over time and, hopefully, the community will help it grow into a central repository geared towards helping those on the job hunt.
