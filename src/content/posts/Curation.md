Some of my favorite Internet finds are websites dedicated to telling their readers about a single subject. Curated and maintained by a single person or a community of folks in their spare time, they are rarely terribly fancy. They might have a blog, update feed, or tools of some kind, but these particular kinds of websites are intentionally designed to stand as independent, growing, evergreen repositories of information about a single subject.\
