I attended Vueconf.US 2025 this past week as it returned to Tampa, Florida! This was a bit of a homecoming for me, as Vueconf.US was where I gave my first-ever talk to a live crowd when it was last in Tampa in 2019. I finally got some time to write, having taken the week off to also celebrate graduations and get some downtime, so here's a recap and some thoughts on my experience!

## My history with Vue

For those unfamiliar with my backstory, I cut my teeth using front-end frameworks with Vue.js back when I worked for Tenet Partners as a full-stack web developer in 2016. When a client requested custom features to help their employees select the right letterhead for their communications, I was challenged to add single-page application-like features to a predominantly multi-page application built on .NET Web Forms. After reviewing multiple options, I landed on Vue.js for its developer experience and progressive approach to installation. I worked with Vue in various roles until my current role at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, where I work predominantly with React and HTML5 custom elements. All that to say, I have quite a bit of history with the framework.

## Two days of great talks

Vueconf.US features a day of workshops, which I didn't get to attend, followed by two days of fantastic talks, the first of which was all stress because I was [one of the speakers](https://vueconf.us/session?sessionId=824948 "Session page for \"Full-Circle: A time traveler's perspective on Vue\"")!

My talk, "Full-Circle: A Time Traveler's Perspective on Vue," is a recap of the last ten or so years of Vue's ecosystem. Like the title suggests, it's from the perspective of someone who used to work within the ecosystem and is returning to it after years away. When I started researching for this talk, what was a comparison of what I used to work with and what Vue developers are using also became a discussion about the impact of Vue 3's rewrite, the struggles of major migrations, and the impact engineering decisions can have on developers and engineers.

Giving the talk and hoping all my slides worked was one thing, but it was another thing to be giving it following the creator of the Vue framework, Evan You! No pressure, right?

Evan forwent his typical "State of Vue"-style talk and gave us a technical look at Vue's upcoming [Vapor Mode](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/the-future-of-vue-vapor-mode/). Rather than a virtual DOM to handle rendering, Vapor Mode provides an opt-in compilation strategy that forgoes the use of VDOM runtimes, increasing performance with no change to developer experience. This is part and parcel of the Vue team's strategy to surface more behind-the-scenes updates moving forward from Vue 3.\
