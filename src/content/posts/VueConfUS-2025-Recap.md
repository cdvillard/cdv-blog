I attended Vueconf.US 2025 this past week as it returned to Tampa, Florida! This was a bit of a homecoming for me, as Vueconf.US was where I gave my first-ever talk to a live crowd when it was last in Tampa in 2019. I finally got some time to write, having taken the week off to also celebrate graduations and get some downtime, so here's a recap and some thoughts on my experience!

## My history with Vue

For those unfamiliar with my backstory, I cut my teeth using front-end frameworks with Vue.js back when I worked for Tenet Partners as a full-stack web developer in 2016. When a client requested custom features to help their employees select the right letterhead for their communications, I was challenged to add single-page application-like features to a predominantly multi-page application built on .NET Web Forms. After reviewing multiple options, I landed on Vue.js for its developer experience and progressive approach to installation. I worked with Vue in various roles until my current role at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, where I work predominantly with React and HTML5 custom elements. All that to say, I have quite a bit of history with the framework.

## Day 1... and I'm Talk #2!

Vueconf.US typically has a day of workshops before two days of talks, but as I didn't get to attend the workshops, my first day was all talks. Admittedly, the morning was all stress because I was [one of the speakers](/talks/full-circle-vueconfus-2025/ "Slides for \"Full-Circle: A time traveler's perspective on Vue\"")!
