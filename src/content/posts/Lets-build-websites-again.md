In a bid to start working more for myself last year, I took on a part-time freelance project to build and launch the website for a local martial artist's Kali seminars business. As of writing, version 1.0 is [live now](https://victorykali.com/), and we have plans to add a bunch of features in the coming months. It's been a refreshing change of pace to build compared to my day-to-day work as I got carte blanche to do with it pretty much whatever I liked. It's built on top of [Astro](https://astro.build/) with TypeScript, because why not, and uses some cool tools like [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/), [Splide](https://splidejs.com/), and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). It was a blast to build!

It was also challenging to complete, and is dirt-simple and rough under the hood.

Don't get me wrong! I'm very proud of how it looks! My client is very happy with it, and he's already received great feedback! What I don't want to do, though, is not acknowledge what this project taught me where I'm at professionally, and where front-end development is today.
