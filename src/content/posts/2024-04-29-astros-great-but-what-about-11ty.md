* FEDC featured a fair amount of Astro
* Intro Astro for those who don't know it
* But Astro came along after Eleventy
* Intro Eleventy for those who don't know it
* Why does Astro seem to have dominated the conversation
* What's happened to Eleventy? What's going on with it?
* **CONSIDER**: Reach out to Zach for a statement?
* Look into history of Astro and Eleventy
* Point to the fact that they're not opposing tools, just solving different things
*
