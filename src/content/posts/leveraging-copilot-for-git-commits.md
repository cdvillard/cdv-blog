* best practice of git: commit often
* i don't do that.
* I'm often catching myself deep down a rabbit hole, and i forget all the changes i made and how they affect everything.
* what i'll do when i find myself in that position is i'll diff each file to read changes and try to understand which i may want to group together in a commit.
* that can be time consuming, but as I'm trying to leverage ai more in my workflows, i've found my editor of choice has a nifty feature that helps with commits
* Source Control in sidebar, a feature of vs code, offers a copilot integration specifcally for commit messaging
* click an icon, and it'll draft the message for you
*
