I signed up for Twitter, now known as X, in 2008, but wasn't an active user until the early to late 2010s. It was around this time I began exploring web development. The common advice amongst my mentors was to start a Twitter profile because that's where the web development community was most active. Becoming more active on the platform, I built up my professional network, found opportunities, and developed... something of a personal brand. While I wouldn't attribute Twitter to the successes of my career, it certainly helped me participate in the community.

Today, I hardly recognize the platform anymore. Since the keys changed hands and the new owners posted that ridiculous kitchen sink video, it was clear the platform would change. Those changes started drastically enough, but to what degree they would go in the long run wasn't clear. Today, we see what decisions like changing the platform's name, laying off critical departments, deeply monetizing major existing features, and more recently, disabling critical safety tools have wrought.\
\
I'm primarily a front-end developer. That means I often deal with user experience-adjacent concerns, and the environments developed for users. More and more the Internet has become a part of our daily lives, a part of our environments, and thus more impactful to our worldview, how we view ourselves, and how we view others. Many people don't see the Internet as anything more than a reference tool, but just as many are constantly connected, skewing increasingly toward younger adults, teenagers, and children. These younger generations see Internet access as an expectation of their everyday world, not a new feature like older generations. That's why the online environments we develop must be built with trust and safety as first-class concerns, moreso than performance, profitability, and features.\
\
For all of its warts and issues, Twitter grew some understanding of those concerns over time. The current regime running what was once Twitter doesn't understand that, nor do they seem to care. Their latest revisions to the application say as much.\
\
I have continued using the application since the change in ownership because of the time I had invested in building my network and presence there. The reach the platform provides can't be denied, but that reach is an artifact of time and a version of the platform that no longer exists. I'm not one of the larger creators on the platform, receiving ad revenue for engagement. Nor am I one of the platform's subscribers, receiving access to features. My investment in the platform paid out when I was able to speak and interact with people in my industry in a way I enjoyed. So to that end, I'll likely start looking to bluer skies and other places to make my mark, if this trend continues.
