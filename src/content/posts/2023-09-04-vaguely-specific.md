When I started learning web development in the far-off year of 2014, jobs building websites fit into three categories. You were likely either a backend developer working on business logic, a frontend developer cutting up and coding designs, or a full-stack developer working on some of both. The responsibilities of each varied company to company but for the most part, if you built websites for a living, you were one of the three.

Five years later, the lines were starting to blur quite a bit for front-end developers. In 2019, Chris Coiyer gave us with [a talk and an article](https://css-tricks.com/ooooops-i-guess-were-full-stack-developers-now/) that painted the picture of just how broad the field of front-end web development had become. That and his essay, [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/), pretty much covered the lived experience of front-end developers in the job market, and still do these days.

That said, while I don't have near the amount of experience and exposure to industry that Chris does, I think it's fair to say that our jobs have only gotten even more ambiguous. Taking a look at job searches these days for “front-end engineers” casts a pretty wide net. I'd go so far as to say that net has some pretty big holes in it, too.

Five years ago, the mindset around front-end engineering was that, as long as you knew HTML, CSS, maybe Sass, JavaScript, a frontend framework like React, and could fetch data with promises, you could find work. Fast forward a few years today, and that's changed. A lot. React is the bare minimum. You'll need to know your TypeScript, some GraphQL, and likely how to navigate through Next.js. Some backend experience could also help. However, most important, and somewhat undiscussed, is that you have to have experience in a domain.
