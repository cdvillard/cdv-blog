The song-and-dance routine that is "finding a job in tech" seems more difficult than ever in 2024. I know many people with extensive technical backgrounds who can't land interviews, let alone get hired. The reasons for that are potentially myriad. Gluts of talent due to layoffs, a lack of investment in specific areas of development, and shifts toward using AI to filter candidates despite potential programmatic biases have been in headlines for the state of the tech job market in some capacity. While they may be factors, we as an industry need to consider another possibility. Maybe those of us technologists looking for jobs are getting in our own way as well, and I want to call out the issue with my whole chest:

**If you're applying for a job, you need to do it with feeling.** You must put in the effort; you must actually try.

Because when you don't, the state of the industry isn't why you're not finding work. The reason becomes you.

## Two left feet

Speaking with a friend who recently helped sort applications for a technical role at an early-stage startup, I asked how the review went. My friend pulled out some numbers and, given the process and methodologies they used, let's say the results were not encouraging. If these were not anecdotal and represented any signifier of how technologists apply to jobs across the industry today, it would make it harder to cheer for job-seekers.

The goal for this particular review was to select candidates for the first round of interview calls. Candidates' application packages were reviewed by a human being with no use of AI and sorted into three categories:

* "Consider Interviewing," which is pretty self-explanatory
* "Pass" represented those who completed the application in full and were qualified based on technical expertise but were passed on based on their answers to questions on the application form.
* "Disqualified," as in passed on from the outset due to basic errors such as providing only a first name or a broken portfolio link.

Out of approximately 400 candidates, **85% were immediately "disqualified."** Less than 5% of qualified candidates were eligible for interviews.

What's more, those disqualified were for easy wins that they let lapse into unprofessional mistakes. Questions were left minimally answered, resumes submitted listed nothing related to the role, personal information was left incomplete, broken LinkedIn URLs -- it's LinkedIn, how do you have a broken profile link?!

## The steps haven't changed.

The cadence for finding a job in tech has barely changed since I started looking for my first full-time role in 2016, and neither has the general advice. It's an imperfect system, and all the gripes people tend to have with today's processes are valid, but it boggles my mind to think that many applicants find the trickiest step in this waltz to be filling out the application.

In a way, I understand it. I've filed my fair share of applications with just a resume and some identifying information, but only because that's what it asked for. If I found a role I wanted that required some questions answered, I at least set those aside to work on my answers truthfully and thoroughly.\
\
What amazed me most was the sense of apathy towards filling out an application when I heard those numbers. To hear that more than 340 people who filled out the application, supposedly looking for meaningful employment, were either too tired or didn't care enough to fill out the application was disheartening. But in the face of the current hiring rates in the tech industry, that apathy makes the popular discourse around bashing companies for using AI to select candidates look very weak.

## Practice your tempo
