The song-and-dance routine that is "finding a job in tech" seems more difficult than ever in 2024. I know many people with extensive technical backgrounds who can't land interviews, let alone get hired. The reasons for that are potentially myriad: gluts of talent due to layoffs, a lack of investment in specific areas of development, shifts towards using AI to filter candidates despite potential programmatic bias. Despite those reasons, it seems those of us technologists looking for jobs are getting in our own way, and we must address this out loud.

I'll call out the issue with my chest: If you're applying for a job, you need to do it with some feeling. Because when you don't, the state of the industry isn't why you're not finding work. The reason becomes you.

## The steps haven't changed.

The cadence for finding a job in tech has barely changed since I started looking for my first full-time role in 2016, and neither has the general advice:

1. Build yourself a small marketing campaign with collateral: an accomplishment-highlight resume, a website showing off blog posts or projects, a GitHub profile showing off code, a LinkedIn profile with recommendations and highlights, etc.
2. Hunt down job listings on companies' job pages, Indeed, LinkedIn, WeWorkRemotely, or any of the myriad other sources.
3. You fill out applications for those jobs you think you're most qualified to do and maybe even some you think might be a longshot to land.
4. And then you wait, at the mercy of whoever has the task of sifting through the applications, for either an invitation for a call or a rejection letter.

It's an imperfect system, and all the gripes people tend to have with this process are valid, but it boggled my mind to learn that many applicants seem to find the trickiest step in this waltz to be step number three.

I enjoyed speaking with a friend who recently helped review applications for a technical role at an early-stage startup. I asked how the review went, and given the process and methodologies they used, the numbers my friend pulled out were, let's say, not encouraging, and make it harder to cheer for job-seekers if this is any signifier of how technologists apply to jobs across the industry-at-large these days.

The goal for this review round was to select candidates for the first round of interview calls. Candidates' application packages were reviewed by a human being with no AI involvement, and sorted into three categories:

* "Consider Interviewing," which is pretty self-explanatory
* "Pass," which represented those who completed the application in full and were qualified based on technical expertise, but were passed on based on their answers to questions asked on the application form.
* "Disqualified," as in passed on from the outset due to basic errors such as providing only a first name or a broken portfolio link.

Of a pool of approximately 400 candidates, 85% of candidates were immediately disqualified.

At the very least, it makes the popular discourse around bashing companies for using AI to select candidates look very weak.
