- loved debate class
- Was discouraged from heavy use of “like” or “um”
- Especially in presentations which makes sense
- Feels like it's bled into conversations in professional settings
- Has bled over into social conversations as well
- In hindsight, I kind of value those small moments as they let me clarify my thoughts whild holding my place.
- A silent break might let someone jump in and I don't finish my thought, they might nto get context
- Maybe this is representative of our era of social media and constant connectivity, especially post-pandemic in US
- Before we had more moments of disconnectedness, even in times right before panedemic
- People say more with their thoughts. Not so much anymore.
