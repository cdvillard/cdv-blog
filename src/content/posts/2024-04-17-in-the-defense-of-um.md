* loved debate class
* Was discouraged from heavy use of “like” or “um”
* Especially in presentations which makes sense
* Feels like it's bled into conversations in professional settings
* Has bled over into social conversations as well
* In hindsight, I kind of value those small moments as they let me clarify my thoughts whild holding my place.
* A silent break might let someone jump in and I don't finish my thought, they might nto get context
* Maybe this is representative of our era of social media and constant connectivity, especially post-pandemic in US
* Before we had more moments of disconnectedness, even in times right before panedemic
* People say more with their thoughts. Not so much anymore.
