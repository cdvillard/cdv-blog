The end of 2025 was... well, it sucked. Getting laid off is never fun.

Immediately after I got the news, I started reaching out to people in my network to find something fast. If you're someone who reached out to me, thank you for the kind words, support, opportunities, and referrals. If you're someone who never knew me before last November and met with me anyways, thank you for your consideration, guidance, direction, and time. I'm really grateful to be in touch with so many brilliant, empathetic people.

The holidays were really a bit of a mess for me, getting ready to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas in between the severance paperwork, intro calls, panel interviews, technical assessments, coding exercises, and feedback reviews. Lots of possibilities were considered: pivoting to developer relations, switching to DevOps or AI engineering, freelancing, starting my own thing. None of these options were realistic in the short term, but between the economy, the industry, and my pyramid of intrinsic needs, I was willing to consider them.

As luck would have it, an organization I applied to shortly before I was released reached out to me. It wasn't one I expected to hear back from, but it was one of those opportunities you get curious about because it generates a feeling. Kind of like being a teenager and landing a gig at that one shop you and your friends always stopped by.

Well, after many conversations with their team, I can say I've accepted an offer from them. I won't be saying who they are just yet, but I start next Monday. I couldn't be more grateful for the chance.\

Week one is going to be a lot.
