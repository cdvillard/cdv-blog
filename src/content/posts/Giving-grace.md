description: 'Sometimes, rest is sweeter.'

I have a confession to make: despite having kept up with my commitment publishing to my blog every day for what's now three days in a row, I am only human. While I was drafting my post about [human curation](https://charlesvillard.co/blog/curation/), I was truly and utterly exhausted from the culmination of a busy work day and a severe case of [revenge bedtime procrastination](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-revenge-bedtime-procrastination-5189591). I was trying to drum up my thoughts while also calling into a late-night push-to-production meeting with about 100 of my closest co-workers, just in case something needed a last-minute bug fix.

Between the fact-checking and fits of micro-sleeping, I had already lost my progress, twice, to sleepily drifting fingers accidentally closing or refreshing the browser window I was editing the post in. That sure well teaches me to not write drafts in an online editor. For the curious and opinionated, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my go-to tool as I'm writing this.

After losing my introduction a second time, I had to laugh at myself and find some folks to laugh with me. Sharing my experience on my Discord server of choice netted me what was an appropriate response.![](</public/assets/media/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 9.56.26â€¯PM.png>)

Fair enough, but I was really excited to expand on the intersection between curated subject matter websites, the need for human connection, and a lack of community and conversation for web developers ever since Twitter changed. This was going to be a truly insightful post! I had to get it down and published for the masses to read so I could change the minds of powerful people at a fundamental level!

Then I looked at the clock. It was 1:00 am. I had to get up the next morning to get the kids' school lunches ready and hop on a networking call. As they say, time is undefeated.

So, I'll be giving myself some grace, especially when I want to write but rest is required. That post about community and conversation is still forthcoming, but it will have to wait for a more rested version of myself to write it. At the very least, a tomorrow version. Right now, I'm going to bed.
