After I updated my post about [replacing ESLint with Biome ](https://charlesvillard.co/blog/2024-04-07-a-new-developer-biome-get-it/)for a work project, I asked in a Discord server how I could set up my [RSS feed ](https://charlesvillard.co/rss.xml)to share that a post was updated. Soneone shortly after shared with me their entire approach. They linked me everything including their schemas, their conditional logic, their XML setup, everything to help me get an “updated” property on my RSS feed. My response: "I'm stealing this during lunch. This is really cool, thank you!"

Me from ten years ago, just learning to code, would have never dreamed of saying that. Taking someone's work and co-opting it for my own purposes seemed wrong, felt wrong. Today, and back then in all honesty, it was fine.





Oh, and their response when I said I was stealing it? “you are very welcome!!”

## Overwhelm

There was a time where I wouldn't dreamed of saying that. I've got to fess up to something: I never developed the habit of coding on my own time. I also, until recently, haven't written much in my free time. I used to study journalism before I became a father, but between then and now, I've hardly written anything that I'd call “good.”

The “why” is likely not a major revelation. In my case, it's the sum total of analysis paralysis, a fear of success, imposter syndrome, and a fear of failure. Cut all that with a limited amount of time and bandwidth in a given day. Bake at 350 degrees Farenheit for 20 minutes. It's a pretty basic, common recipe.

One of the first things I wanted to build when I started learning web development was a website for myself. The first step I thought of was, I better look up some inspiration and see what others have done. What do they post on their portfolios?

One Google search later and my early-career web developer brain was dumbfounded. The top results were basically listicles featuring [amazing](https://bruno-simon.com/), [unique](http://www.rleonardi.com/), [well-crafted](https://2019.wattenberger.com/) [portfolios](https://www.adhamdannaway.com/). Crawling through Twitter bios uncovered me even more, chockfull of [insightful](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/) [blog posts](https://danmall.com/) about [their experiences](https://daverupert.com/) and [their work](https://chriscoyier.net/). [So](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/) [much](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) [inspiration](https://bradfrost.com/)! What ever could I do with it all?!

I created a folder in the bookmarks bar of my browser, saved them all there, and called it a day.

It was too much. All of these websites showed something about these developers and engineers that I just didn't have on a fundamental level: personality, insight, experience, confidence, skill. There was no way I could build something comparable.

I believe heavily that if there's one person that feels a way about something, there are more. Surely, I was never alone in this, but I certainly felt alone. Seeing my contemporaries grow leaps and bounds past me didn't help matters either.

## Lie, Cheat, Steal

Not in any nefarious way, mind you. I simply told myself that, if I wanted to get to that level, I was going to have to be ruthless and intense with myself and my fears. I was gonna have to lie, cheat, and steal my way.

It became one of the first talk ideas I ever had, which I'm glad never became anything because who on Earth was I to be giving advice at the time? Who am I now anyways?

The point was I would lie to myself that I could do this and work towards proving myself right, cheat by using tools and abstractions until I was ready to learn how they worked, and steal inspiration from those around me. It was that framework that got me past a lot of early paralysis analysis and to learn more about web development.  It was freeing to give myself this permission. It let me build the things I wanted without the worry about whether the idea was original or unique or innovative. The point was, I was building things and learning because of it.
