I'm currently on the market looking for a new full-time software engineering role! What follows is a bit about myself and what I'm looking for in my next position.

## I am a...

### Builder of digital things

I level up websites and applications with modern tooling and best practices, curating cohesive and compelling brand stories, building intuitive user interfaces for unique solutions, and developing tooling and platforms to help other engineers excel.

### Flexible learner

I pride myself on the ability to learn and become productive with new languages and esoteric tools quickly. I'm not afraid to step outside my comfort zone, and I'm always willing to experiment, explore, and come back with insights.

### Collaborator

Collaboration on diverse, cross-functional teams is important to me, learning from the perspectives of others, whether they're designers, marketers, engineers, product managers, or otherwise.

### Presence on stage and screen

I enjoy employing my background in communications to present demos, speak on podcasts, deliver talks, and even read lines for voice acting. I've presented at multiple hackathons, hosted meetups and conferences, and have spoken to college students about web development and the tech industry.

### Advocate for the community

Advocacy is something I care about very much. I do my best to be an active participant in the discourse of the web development community in social media threads, Discord servers, and Slack channels.

## What I'm looking for

### Frontend and Full-stack Development

I have a decade of experience in frontend and full-stack development, building intuitive, accessible user interfaces and integrating APIs written in PHP, Ruby on Rails, and TypeScript. I've even worked on ASP.NET Web Forms projects in C#.

Some of my favorite projects involve informing and enabling others with the best experience possible, whether that's building tools for development teams or open-source, applications for users, or marketing websites to inform visitors. I enjoy roles with novel problems to solve that allow experimentation and are open to suggestions.

Roles I'm interested in:

* Frontend or Full-stack Engineer
* Design or UI Engineer
* Design Technologist
* UI Platform Engineer
* Web Engineer

And I'm definitely open to discussing their "senior," "staff," and "developer" derivatives as well.

### Developer Advocacy

Another area that's been particularly interesting to me has been developer advocacy. I enjoy working with developers, communities, and non-technical staff to find answers to novel questions, and bring constructive feedback to project owners and engineering teams. If you are hiring for roles involved in developer relations, advocacy, evangelism, documentation, or similar, please feel free to reach out! I'd love to have a conversation.

## What makes a role stand out

Beyond the salary, there are a few things an organization can offer that would catch my attention.

* I prefer and have thrived in remote roles. Currently based outside of Tampa, Florida, so I am also open to flexibly hybrid roles within the Central Florida area. I'm also open to discussing relocation, though I expect it would be difficult at this time.
* Medical, dental, and vision benefits that significantly cover the health costs of both myself and my family
* 401k match
* Inclusive employee resource groups that represent the diversity of your organization
* Professional development budget
* Flexibility to pursue personal growth opportunities like speaking engagements

## Things I'm not looking for

I'm willing to consider positions at many companies or for a variety of causes, but there are a few lines and veils I do my best to adhere to.

I'm not interested in roles that focus heavily on direct sales, account management, people management, or marketing. I enjoy being as close to the code as possible.

While the tenants of decentralization are appealing and I wouldn't mind exploring projects like the AT protocol more, I'm not interested in working in web3, blockchain, or cryptocurrency. Nor am I interested in military defense contracting.
