  The importance of building stuff as a software engineer is more than just
  redesigning your BlogPostPreview component again.

  Me starting at my keyboard and various Rubber Duck Replacements trying to
  figure out another impulsive blog rework.

* As of writing this blog has all of four posts. Two of actual content, and one encouraging people to keep writing.
* My only excuse for the hypocrisy of that last one. A work project building a redesigned dashboard kept me away for six months. Beyond that, no excuse available.
* In fact, I come back and draft this with the same feeling that drove me to redesigning my blog in the first place: a sense of guilt for abandoning it as a project.
* However, I realized shortly after I began trying to design in code (terrible idea btw, design THEN code) that no, the guilt isn't coming from me abandoning the blog as a project. It's coming from having nothing really new to blog about.
* I can write about
