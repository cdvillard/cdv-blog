Earlier this year, I got to shoot an episode of Leet Heat! Jason Lengstorf, Mark Techson, Annie Sexton, and the entire crew were phenomenal to work with. I'm writing this well before the episodes air, so I can talk about my experience while it's fresh. Consider this a little peek behind the scenes.

For those who haven't seen it yet, Leet Heat is a game show concept from the mind of Jason Lengstorf. If you like Jeopardy, web development, and Hot Ones, you will certainly dig this! Dubbed "the worst technical interview ever," two contestants spin a wheel of category tiles and answer questions based on whatever category it lands on. Should they get it wrong, they're docked points, increase their spice level, and have to eat a spicy bite. Every game also starts with one "Leet Heat" tile, and as the questions for each category are depleted, that category also becomes a "Leet Heat" tile! When a player spins and lands on that, their spice level is automatically increased and they have to eat a spicy bite. Whoever gets the most points at the end of two rounds wins.

Walking into the studio, I was blown away by the set. The whole thing is shot on several cameras with Mark, Annie, Jason, and the contestants miked up. The crew was amazing, handling lighting, sound, hair, makeup, props, set design, still photography, and video production. They made us all look fantastic! I can't thank them enough.

Seeing all of that made being there all the more real, and I have to admit my nerves started getting to me. I've been on a stage in front of people before, but this had been the first time in a long while. My biggest fear at that moment was seizing up in front of the camera, but everyone had my back. My opponent, Brittany Ellich, was super encouraging and kept me cool in the moments leading up to our shoot, and Mark was ever the consummate host and performer, checking in on us when he could, keeping us loose, and having fun the entire time we were at those podiums.

After our episode was in the can, I hung out there for the rest of the day and got to see more of the behind-the-scenes process. The goal was to shoot five episodes in a day, and despite any setbacks or hold-ups, Jason and the crew managed to knock them all out on time. Given the number of moving parts and variables, it's hard to describe how impressive a feat this was. Once a groove was found, everything fell into place and everyone on the cast and crew worked in sync. I'm pretty sure this is what the phrase "movie magic" refers to.

While this will likely be the corniest line I ever wrote, the real magic was indeed the amazing group of people I got to meet along the way. I got to meet so many cool people that I've only gotten to interact with online. There's something about connecting with other web developers and software engineers that re-energizes me about this work. It gets me wanting to build something cool, whatever that is! If you're reading this and we met on the Leet Heat set, you were an absolute pleasure to hang out with, and I hope we can do it again some time!\

I can't thank Jason enough for letting me be a part of this, and I can't wait for you to watch these episodes! Some are hilarious, others are real nail-biters. My big ask of you is that you please check them out so we can do more cool stuff like this in our community! The more that companies see we like this kind of content, the more companies might be willing to sponsor it, and the more opportunities we create for our community to make and build fun stuff together!
