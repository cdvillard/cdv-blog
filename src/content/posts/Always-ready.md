description: A way to reframe general capability over specialization

Before web development, I spent part of my life as a member of a volunteer stage combat troupe that put on shows at foster system events, renaissance fairs, and comic book conventions. My time practicing punches, pratfalls, and sword parries gave me an appreciation for martial arts, spectacle, and showmanship. Through that lens it also helped me appreciate for the orchestration and presentation of professional wrestling. That's how I came to learn about Matt Cardona.

You'd be well forgiven for not knowing who Cardona is if you don't follow wrestling. I didn't either until more recently, so I won't bore you with his backstory, save one part. Despite great success and innovation on Cardona's part through the use of social media, the popular promotion where he performed under another name released him. Cardona found that, while they didn't appreciate what he could do, he was ready and able to adapt the new landscape outside that promotion. His efforts kept him in the conversation, earned him opportunities, and led him to success after success in both the independent and professional wrestling scenes.

Throughout his reinvention, he's kept one theme consistent, loud, and upfront. When his entrance theme plays as he walks to the ring, the first words the audience always hears is an exclamation of "Always ready!"

It's his catchphrase, tagline, preamble. Hell, it may as well be his nom de plume. Cardona's made it such a central part to his personal brand that any deep fan of wrestling will likely picture him in a Pavlovian response if you utter it.

So, what does any of this have to do with web development?
