description: A way to reframe general capability over specialization
---

Before I found web development, some time of my life was spent as part of a rag-tag stage combat troupe that put on shows at renaissance fairs and comic book conventions. Practicing punches, pratfalls, and parries gave me an appreciation for martial arts, spectacle, and showmanship. It's through that lens that I also grew an appreciation for the orchestration and presentation of professional wrestling, and how I came to learn about wrestler Matt Cardona.

You'd be well forgiven for not knowing who Cardona is if you don't follow wrestling. I didn't either until more recently, many years since a younger me watched Nitro and SmackDown. He was after my time.

I won't bore you with his backstory, save one part. After being let go from a long tenure with a popular promotion, Cardona found he had to shed the baggage of his old characters and reinvent himself. Instead of putting fresh paint on his old gimmick, he adapted to a new landscape. His efforts kept him in the conversation, earned him opportunities, and led him to success in both the independent and professional wrestling scenes.

Throughout his reinvention, he's kept one theme consistent, loud, and upfront. As his entrance theme plays before he walks to the ring, the first words you hear is an exclamation of "Always ready!"

It's his catchphrase, tagline, preamble. Hell, it may as well be his nom de plume. Cardona's made it such a central part to his personal brand that any deep fan of wrestling will likely picture him in a Pavlovian response if you utter it.

So, like so many LinkedIn users rolling their eyes at another seven lessons in sales derived from someone dropping their chili dog in the dirt, you might be wondering, so what? Why even write about this? What does any of this have to do with web development?

The dramatic shifts in web development over the last fives years aren't necessarily new, but they are new enough that many are still making sense of what's happened. Between socioeconomic changes, political uncertainty, and the heavy investment into and indexing on LLMs, the future for engineers in the industry has never been more unclear. 

Whether it's someone entering the job market, looking for a more senior role, or somewhere in between, roles aren't as easy to find these days. That's not just in web development, either. This can be said for just about any part of the software engineering industry.

I put forth that some of that uncertainty comes from deep specialization. One attribute that can help defend against that uncertainty is flexibility. 

There was a time when developers joked about being a full-stack developer.
