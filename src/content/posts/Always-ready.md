Before I get into this, I need to provide some quick personal background that I think will lend some much needed context. When I was younger, I spent some time as part of a rag-tag stage combat troupe that put on shows at renaissance fairs and comic book conventions. My time practicing punches, pratfalls, and parries gave me an appreciation for martial arts, spectacle, and sportsmanship. It's through that lens that I also have an appreciation for the orchestration and execution behind professional wrestling, and how I came to learn about wrestler Matt Cardona.

You'd be well forgiven for not knowing who Cardona is if you don't follow wrestling. I didn't either until more recently, many years since a younger me watched Nitro and RAW. He was after my time.

I won't bore you with his backstory, save one part. After being let go from a long tenure with a popular promotion, Cardona found he had to shed the baggage of his old characters and reinvent himself. Instead of putting fresh paint on an old gimmick, he adapted to a new landscape. His efforts kept him in the conversation, earned him opportunities, and led him to success in both the independent and professional wrestling scenes.

Throughout his reinvention, he's kept one thing consistent, and he lets you know it upfront. As his entrance theme plays before he walks to the ring, the first thing you hear is an exclamation: "Always ready!"

It's his catchphrase, tagline, preamble. Hell, it may as well be his nom de plume. Cardona's made it such a central part to his personal brand that any deep fan of wrestling will likely picture him in a Pavlovian response if you utter it.

So, like so many LinkedIn users rolling their eyes at another seven lessons in sales derived from someone dropping their chili dog in the dirt, you might be wondering, so what? Why even write about this? What does any of this have to do with web development?
