A friend in an online tech community I frequent was preparing for an upcoming job interview at a pretty high-profile startup and asked for some advice. The expectations the company had laid out for the interview seemed pretty bog-standard but one particular item prompted my friend to seek some guidance. Paraphrasing a bit, interviewees were expected to answer the following:

> What's a complex project you've worked on, relevant to this position? Who did you collaborate with? How did you contribute to the project? What were some challenges you overcame? How did you work affect the project in the end?

This is a fairly common question to get asked, and it always seems daunting to answer, whether you were warned ahead of time or asked the question on the spot. In my mind, it all comes down to two key parts of that first sentence.

> What's a complex project you've worked on...?

Imagine getting asked this while you're ordering a meal at a restaurant, on the spot. Oh, goodness. What's a complex project I worked on? What work did I complete that was genuinely complex, let alone relevant to the next job I want to get?
