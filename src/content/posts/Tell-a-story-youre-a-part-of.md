description: Sometimes the story you need to tell isn't about just you.

A friend of mine was preparing for a job interview at a pretty high-profile startup. The recruiter's expectations for the interview seemed pretty bog-standard, but one particular item prompted my friend to seek some guidance. Paraphrasing a bit, the prompt stated interviewees were expected to talk about a few things including:

> What's a complex project you've worked on, relevant to this position? Who did you collaborate with? How did you contribute to the project? What were some challenges you overcame? How did you work affect the project in the end?

These are fairly common questions to get asked in interviews, especially for tech-related jobs. Yet, it always seems daunting to answer, whether you were warned ahead of time or asked the question on the spot. That first part can hit the panic button the hardest.

> What's a complex project you've worked on...?

Imagine getting asked this while you're ordering a meal at a restaurant, right when the waiter walks up. I'd wager your first thought may be, "Wait, what? I just want a sandwich." Give it a second, let it sink in, and your next thought may be, "Oh, goodness. What's a complex project I worked on? What work did I complete that was genuinely complex, let alone relevant to the next job I want to get?"

I would wager that, for most people, the first response is to scroll through their job history in their minds and find the most complex project they delivered, start to finish, top to bottom, that they made the calls on. I'm hardly innocent of this myself. I can count on my fingers how many times I answered similar questions with a vote of confidence, and that would be a good guess at best.

For my friend, the nuance of answering this question wasn't about what complex project he solved, but that he hadn't solved any complex problems yet, in his mind. How was he to honestly answer this with very little work experience under his belt? 

## Main character syndrome

In this day, the age of AI-driven web scrappers, I presume you who are reading this are like me and are human. We naturally tend to center ourselves when we're asked questions about what we've done. It's natural, but it can also be uncomfortable for a lot of people. Let's take a second to re-interpret the prompt, though.

Instead of thinking about it as:

> What's a complex task you yourself organized, led, championed, and delivered?

Let's try interpreting it as:

> What work have you done that has contributed to a complex project?

Suddenly, answering this just got a lot easier, didn't it?

## Part of the sum

Typically, most people working on software, let alone anything in general, don't solve complex projects all on their own. Any given project is usually broken down into tasks and delegated to people, often based on their specialties or bandwidth, in hopefully the most effective way. Sure, sometimes there are highly passionate, high-output contributors whose work supports the outcomes of the project to an outsized degree, but they're outliers and even their work doesn't usually meet the project's goals in and of itself. Heck, Batman could thwart the best-laid plans of many villains, but even he had Alfred.

 A mid-level front-end developer may just develop components and layouts all day, but could easily speak to how their tough conversation with a designer about an animation improved the feature's accessibility. A junior backend developer may just fix buggy API code all day, but he could speak about how his collaboration with QA improved performance and memory usage. The question isn't meant to evoke tales about how we solo-conquered a big scary problem as the main character. It's trying to understand what roles you've played on a team, and how your work affected outcomes.

Ultimately, being asked what complex project you've worked on is a chance for us to talk about our smaller part in a larger whole. It's not a question about how you climbed the mountain. It's more about how you and maybe your team worked to make climbing that mountain easier.

A friend of mine was preparing for an upcoming job interview at a pretty high-profile startup. The recruiter's expectations for the interview seemed pretty bog-standard but one particular item prompted my friend to seek some guidance. Paraphrasing a bit, interviewees were expected to answer the following:

> What's a complex project you've worked on, relevant to this position? Who did you collaborate with? How did you contribute to the project? What were some challenges you overcame? How did you work affect the project in the end?

This is a fairly common question to get asked, and it always seems daunting to answer, whether you were warned ahead of time or asked the question on the spot. In my mind, it all comes down to two key parts of that first sentence.

> What's a complex project you've worked on...?

Imagine getting asked this while you're ordering a meal at a restaurant, on the spot. I'd wager your first thought may be, Oh, goodness. What's a complex project I worked on? What work did I complete that was genuinely complex, let alone relevant to the next job I want to get?

I would wager that, for most people, the first response is to scroll through their job history in their minds and find the most complex project they delivered, start to finish, top to bottom, that they made the calls on. I'm hardly innocent of this myself. I can count on my fingers how many times I answered similar questions with a vote of confidence, and that would be a good guess at best.

The reality of it is this line of questioning, and others like it, are not meant to derive answers from us about us. In this age of AI-driven web scrappers, I presume you who are reading this are like me and are human. We naturally tend to center ourselves when we're asked questions about what we've done. However, \

```javascript
// Well, remember that it's not asking you how you handled a complex project on your own, but  what complex projects did your work touch and how your work affected that project. For example, if I were a mid-level front-end developer, I could describe how my work on a UI team developing the code for a major dashboard refresh improved accessibility, and how I had to have hard conversations with design about how parts of that UI couldn't be animated or couldn't be rendered as sticky for XYZ reason. Even though at the end of the say, I just coded some layouts that were requested by the design team.

```

It's not a question about how you climbed the mountain. It's more about how you and maybe your team worked to make climbing that mountain easier, even if your part in that seemed small at the time.
