In 2019 and 2020, entrepreneur, raconteur, and pretty solid coder Chris Coyier gave us a talk and an article that laid bare what a frontend developer has to deal. It's a real good evergreen piece that I highly recommend.

Fast forward to today, and not much has changed. We're still eyeballing new frameworks to see which will bump React. Webpack is still ubiquitous while a bunch of other build tools vye for eyeballs. JavaScript couldn't be more pervasive, while CSS and HTML feel like they've been tossed into the backseat. Accessibility is still largely considered a nice-to-have, which is unfortunate because it ultimately given the same prioritization as tech debt. We all know how that goes.
