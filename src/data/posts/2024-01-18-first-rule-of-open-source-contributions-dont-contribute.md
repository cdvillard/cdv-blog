- Theo made a video about open-source
- I agree, the video makes a point of how good intentions soured things for some people
- Something the video doesn't provide is a positive look into what first contributions could look like
- Want to show what my first contribution looked like
- Outline a path to what an actual impactful contribution could be that doesn't annoy the maintainers
