- Homer Gaines shared a track-in-progress with me
- Hasn't published it yet, but track featured some notes on what to work on
- I listened to it, gave feedback
- Homer found it helpful: he knew about these issues, but was happy to have them validated
- Said he had to be careful, the track would lose its wormth and become flat if he over-engineered it.
